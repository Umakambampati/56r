<h1><u><i>Introduction to Python</i></u></h1>
</center>
<h2><u>1.What is Language?</u></h2>
<p><b>A:</b>A language is a system of communication using symbols, words, or signs.
It helps people express thoughts, ideas, or instructions to others.</p><hr>
<h2><u>2.What is Programming Language?</u></h2>
<p><b>A:</b> programming language is a formal way to give instructions to a computer.
It allows developers to write code that a computer can understand and execute.</p><hr>
<h2><u>3.Why Python is used?</u></h2>
<div><b>A: </b><b>1. Ease of Use:</b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.</div><br>
<div><b>2. Versatility:</b> Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural,functional).</div><br>
<div><b>3. Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web development.</div><br>
<div><b>4. Community Support: </b>Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning.</div><br>
5.<b>Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification(Windows, macOS, Linux).<br><hr>
<h2><u>4.What is Python?</u></h2>
<p><b>A: Python</b> is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its  simplicity and readability </p><hr>
<h2><u> 5.Who created Python, and when was it first released?</u></h2>
<p><b>A: </b>It was created by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> in the late 1980s and first released in <b> 1991 </b>. Python emphasizes  code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object orirneted, procedural programming, functional programming.</p><hr>
<h2><u>6. In which domains is Python generally utilized?</u></h2>
<div><b>A:1.Web development</b> Frameworks: Django,flask</div><br>
<div><b>2.Data Science and Machine Learning</b>: Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy,
Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.</div><br>
<div><b>3.Automation(Scripting):</b></a> Automating repetitive tasks.</div><br>
<div><b>4. Game Development:</b></a> Framework: PyGame.</div><br>
<div><b>5. Scientific Computing:</b></a> Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib.</div><br>
<div><b>6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning:</b></a> Libraries: Keras, PyTorch.</div><br>
<div><b>7.Web Scraping:</b>Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.</div><br>
<div><b>8. Cybersecurity:</b></a> Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities.</div><br><hr>
<h2><u>7. How does Python handle memory, and what is the downside?</u></h2>
<p><b>A:</b> Python uses <b>dynamic typing</b> and garbage collection, which increases memory usage.
This makes it less suitable for memory-critical applications.</p><hr>
<h2><u>8. What is GIL in Python, and why is it a limitation?</u></h2>
<p><b>A: GIL </b>stands for <b>Global Interpreter Lock</b>, which allows only one thread to execute at a time.
This limits multi-threading performance, especially on multi-core processors.</p><hr>
<h2><u>9. Which big companies use Python?</u></h2>
<p><b>A: </b>Major companies using Python include Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, NASA, and Uber.
It’s also used in dashboards like 10000 Coders and platforms like Reddit.</p><hr>
<h2><u>10.What are some other disadvantages of python?</u></h2>
<p><b>A:</b><div><b>1. Slower Execution Speed</b></p>
<div>○ Interpreted language , making it slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java.</div><br>
<div>○ Not ideal for performance-critical applications (e.g., real-time systems, gaming engines).</div>
<p>2.<b>Runtime Errors</b></p>
<div>○ Python’s dynamic nature allows runtime errors to occur if code is not thoroughly tested.</div><br>
<div>○ This can lead to bugs in production if not handled properly.</div>
<p><b>3.Limited Support for Low-Level Programming</b></p>
<div>○ Languages like C or Rust are better suited for such tasks.</div><hr>
<h2><u>11. How is Python interpreted and what does that mean?</u></h2>
<p><b>A: </b>Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. Being interpreted means you don’t need to compile the code — it runs directly, making debugging easier and faster.</p><hr>
<h2><u>12.What are the different datatypes in Python?</u></h2>
<p><b>A:</b>1.<b>int</b>(integer)<br>
2.<b>float</b>(Floating point number)<br>
3.<b>str</b>(String)<br>
4.<b>Bool</b>(Boolean)<br>
5.list,tuple,dict(collection types)
