    <h1 id="about"><u>ABOUT</u></h1><ul>
    <li>My name is K.Uma Maheshwari.I am from Nalgonda. I completed my bachelor of technology in computer science and engineering from mahatma gandhi university.</li><li>coming to my technical skills i am good in C,python,Html,CSS.I had done a projeect called DDOS attack detection using machine learning algorithms.</li><li>The models i used are SVM,decisiontrees,randomforest,to detect the anomolies.</li>
    <li>My hobbies are listening to music which makes my mind calm and relax during stressful times</li><li>My strengths are i am a quicklearner and dedicatd hardworker who finishes the work on time without compromising quality</li><li>My short term goal is to get placed in a good company where i can use my technical  skills and gain hands-on experience and work on real world solutions.</li><li>My long term goal is to become a responsible and professional software developer who lead the teams and contibute to innovations and real world solutions.here's all about me.</li></ul>

  <ul type="circle">
<h3>DDoS Attack Detection on SDN using Machine Learning</h3>

<li>Developed a system to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Software Defined Networks (SDN)</li>

<li>Implemented machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees for attack detection</li>

<li>Achieved detection accuracy of 85% with SVM and 88% with Decision Trees</li>

<li>Analyzed network traffic data to identify malicious patterns effectively</li>

<li>Demonstrated how ML techniques can improve security and resilience in SDN environments.</li></ul>
