    <p class="para">Indian classical dance refers to the traditional performing art forms of India, officially recognized by the government, with the Sangeet Natak Akademi (India's National Academy of Music, Dance and Drama) recognizing eight major forms: Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu), Kathak (Uttar Pradesh), Kathakali (Kerala), Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh), Manipuri (Manipur), Mohiniyattam (Kerala), Odissi (Odisha), and Sattriya (Assam). Each style reflects its region's unique cultural and spiritual heritage, characterized by specific hand gestures (mudras), expressive movements, rhythmic footwork, and narrative themes from Hindu mythology and religious devotion. </p></div>
