    <h2 class="caption"><b>Python Full Stack  Development</b></h2><br>
    <p class="para">Python is used with frameworks such as Django, Flask, or FastAPI to build robust server-side applications, handle API requests, and manage authentication and authorization. Full stack developers also work with databases, both relational (like MySQL and PostgreSQL) and non-relational (like MongoDB), using ORMs like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM to manage data efficiently. Version control tools like Git, along with platforms like GitHub or GitLab, are essential for tracking code changes and collaborating with other developers.</p>

    <h2 class="caption1"><b>Java Full Stack Development</b></h2><br>
    <p class ="caption2">Java Full Stack Development involves building complete web applications using Java for backend development while integrating it with frontend technologies to create a seamless and interactive user experience. A full stack developer handles both the client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) of a web application. On the frontend, technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used, often combined with frameworks such as Angular, React.js, or Vue.js to build responsive and dynamic interfaces. On the backend, Java developers rely on frameworks like Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Hibernate to implement business logic, manage server requests, and handle data interactions efficiently.</p>

    <h2  class="caption3"><b>Data Science</b></h2><br>
    <p class="caption4">Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting meaningful insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data using a combination of statistics, mathematics, programming, and domain expertise. Data scientists collect, clean, and process large volumes of data from multiple sources, then analyze it using techniques such as data visualization, machine learning, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. Tools and programming languages like Python, R, SQL, and Excel are commonly used, alongside libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.</p>

    <h2 class="caption5"><b>Cloud Computing</b></h2><br>
    <p class="caption6">Cloud Computing is a technology that allows individuals and organizations to access, store, and manage data and applications over the internet instead of relying on local servers or personal computers. It provides on-demand computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software, which can be scaled up or down based on requirements. Cloud computing is categorized into three main service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which offers virtualized computing resources; Platform as a Service (PaaS), which provides platforms for developing, testing, and deploying applications; and Software as a Service (SaaS), which delivers software applications over the internet.</p>

    <h2 class="caption7"><b>Cyber Security</b></h2><br>
    <p class="caption8">Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, networks, and digital data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It involves implementing measures to defend against threats such as hacking, malware, phishing, ransomware, and data breaches. Cybersecurity professionals work to secure information systems, ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, and protect organizational assets from cyber threats. Key areas include network security, which safeguards network infrastructure; application security, which protects software from vulnerabilities; endpoint security, securing devices like laptops and smartphones; and cloud security, which ensures data safety in cloud environments.</p>
